You are a classification assistant. I’ll attach:
1) A JSON file with an array of Asana tasks (one object per task).
2) rules.json that defines ad-type keywords and default effort minutes.

Goal
For each task, decide:
- category: Drafting | Editing | Publishing | Planning | Other
- ad_type: one of the ad types in rules.json (fall back to "Unclear")
- effort_minutes: integer (choose ONE total effort per task using category + ad_type + rules.json)

Decision rules
1) Category (decide from task name first; if unclear, use notes; else parent.name):
- Drafting: draft, drafted, writing, write, compose, build copy, outline, create copy, first pass
- Editing: edit, edited, edits, copyedit, proof, revision after edit
- Publishing: publish, published, schedule, scheduled, post live, preview link sent, send to client, sent to press
- Planning: plan, planning, brief, kickoff, gather assets, build timeline/timeline, gather results, create highlights, dependencies, coordination
If none match → Other.

2) Ignore hub/container parents:
Skip top-level “anchor” tasks that look like: "<Client> | <Thing> runs <date> | <EDITION>" or "... posted ... | <EDITION>" unless the title itself is actionable (e.g., starts with "Writer:", "Editor:", "Published", "Preview Link", etc.). Subtasks under them are actionable and should be included.

3) Ad type:
Prefer parent.name → task name → projects[].name → notes.
Use rules.json keyword lists and priority. "lead story" beats "article"; "mini" beats "article"; “story” should NOT override “lead story”.

4) Effort minutes:
Pick one number per task. If category = Drafting, use drafting effort from rules.json for the matched ad_type; if Editing/Publishing/Planning/Other, use those efforts from rules.json for the matched ad_type. If no ad_type match, use "Unclear" row’s efforts.

Output (strict JSON)
Return a single JSON object:
{
  "meta": { "week_start": "...", "week_end": "...", "generated_at": "..." },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "gid": "...", "name": "...", "assignee_name": "...", "assignee_gid": "...",
      "due_on": "YYYY-MM-DD", "projects": ["..."], "parent_name": "...", "is_subtask": true,
      "url": "...",
      "category": "Drafting|Editing|Publishing|Planning|Other",
      "ad_type": "Article|Mini Article|Lead Story|Text Ad|Social Post|Instagram Story|Dedicated Email|Engagement Module|Email Header|Unclear",
      "effort_minutes": 90,
      "explain": "short reason"
    }
  ]
}
No markdown. If you skip hub/anchor parents, do not include them in the output.
